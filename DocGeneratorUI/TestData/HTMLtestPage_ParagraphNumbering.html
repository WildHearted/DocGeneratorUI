<h1>Paragraph Numbering</h1>
<p>This test case validates the numbering of paragraphs.</p>
<p>There are a few <strong>types</strong> of paragraphs:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Normal Paragraphs</li>
	<li>Headings</li>
	<li>Organised Lists</li>
	<li>Unorganised Lists</li>
</ol>
<h2>Normal Paragraphs</h2>
<p>Just to make sure we are all on the same page, here is the definition of a paragraph: "<em>A distinct division of written or printed matter that begins on a new, usually indented line, consists of one or more sentences, and typically deals with a single thought or topic or quotes one speaker's continuous words.</em>".</p>
<p>The "section" of text is a separate from the previous section and demarckated as separate "paragraph".</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>A heading is in fact also paragraph. However, the purpose of a heading is to group and title a set of paragraphs into topics or themes.</p>
<h2>Organised Lists</h2>
<p>Organised Lists are also paragraphs, but these paragraphs are usually preceded by a numeric number. It is also known as <strong>Numbered Lists</strong>. The purpose of <em>organised lists</em> or <em>numbered lists</em>, is to indicate a specific <strong>order</strong> of paragraphs. If the order of the paragraphs are not important, then it is more appropriate to use an <em>Unorganised List</em> or a <em>Bullet List</em> that has the same purpose but for which the order if of not relevant.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions it may be necessary to <em>cascade</em> a numbered list into multiple levels to indicate a hierarchy.</p>
<ol>
	<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 1 numbered paragraph.</li>
	<li>This is the 2nd entry for the level 1 numbered paragraph.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 2 paragraph.</li>
		<li>
			<p>This is the 2nd entry for the level 2 paragraph.</p>
		</li>
		<ol>
			<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 3 paragraph.</li>
			<li>
				<p>This is the 2nd entry for the level 3 paragraph.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<li>This is the 3nd entry for the level 2 paragraph.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>This is the 3rd entry for the level 1 paragraph.</li>
</ol>
<p>More normal paragraphs can occur here and then we need to begin with a new hierarchical numbered list. This numbered list continues where the previous list ended. It doesn't restart the numbering, it just continue the numbering.</p>
<ol>
	<li>This is the 4th entry for the level 1 numbered paragraph.</li>
	<li>This is the 5th entry for the level 1 numbered paragraph.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 2 paragraph.</li>
		<li>
			<p>This is the 2nd entry for the level 2 paragraph.</p>
		</li>
		<ol>
			<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 3 paragaph.</li>
			<li>
				<p>This is the 2nd entry for the level 3 paragraph.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<li>This is the 3nd entry for the level 2 paragraph.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>This is the 6th entry for the level 1 paragraph.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then a point is reached where a new hierarchy of a numbered list begin. The next numbered list needs start numbering at one and NOT continue as was the case in the previous example.</p>
<ol>
	<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 1 numbered paragraph.</li>
	<li>This is the 2nd entry for the level 1 numbered paragraph.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 2 paragraph.</li>
		<li>
			<p>This is the 2nd endtry for the level 2 paragraph.</p>
		</li>
		<ol>
			<li>This is the 1st entry for the level 3 paragraph.</li>
			<li>
				<p>This is the 2nd entry for the level 3 paragraph.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<li>This is the 3nd entry for the level 2 paragraph.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>This is the 3rd entry for the level 1 paragraph.</li>
</ol>
<p>This concludes paragraph numbering testing.</p>
