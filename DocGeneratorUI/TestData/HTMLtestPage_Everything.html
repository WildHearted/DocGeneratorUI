<p>This pargraph demonstrates the replacement of HASH TAG Client Name HASH TAG the text hereafter must be replaced with the Client Name because it is the word "ClientName" between two ## characters without any spaces between the #'s and the word: #ClientName#.</p>
<h1>
	<div>This is Heading +1 style</div>
</h1>
<p>This is a standard paragraph as DD Body Text, with additional text to check that the paragraph wraps correctly if it is more than a one liner.</p>
<h2> This is Heading +2 style with a 
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undelined</span> word</h2>

<p>Testing&#160;cascading bullets:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This is a level 1 bullet</li>
	<li>This is the second&#160;Level 1 bullet</li>
	<ul>
		<li>This is the first&#160;Level 2 bullet</li>
		<li>This is the second Level 2 bullet</li>
		<li>This is the third Level 2 bullet</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This is the first Level 3 bullet</li>
			<li>This is the second Level 3 bullet</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This is the first Level 4 bullet. (but the code should collaps this level into a third level)</li>
				<li>Alternatively, this Level 4 and beyound can produce a formatting error</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This Level 5 bullet could also produce a formatting error</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>This is the third Level 3 bullet</li>
		</ul>
		<li>This is the third Level 2 bullet</li>
		<li>This is the fourth Level 2 bullet</li>
	</ul>
	<li>This is the third Level 1 bullet</li>
	<li>This is the last Level 1 bullet</li>
</ul>
<p>This is normal text again.</p>
<h3>Heading +3</h3>
<p>Another instance where the hastag ClientName is replaced with the actual client name: [#ClientName#].</p>
<h4>DD Heading +4</h4>
<p>Yes, even a fourth extra level can be added to the content, and it will be correctly numbered.</p>

	This is a div tag that contains text but no valid html tags. It is an exerpt from live data:  Events are diagnosed by validating them against predefined rules which are documented in the Monitoring Plan. This validation ensures that events that require action, trigger the relevant response.
	<br />Event handling is triggered from this automated validation response, when events are generated by Dimension Data’s monitoring systems.
	<br />Generally, event handling will be:<br />● automated or manual correlation to other events that generate an incident, request, problem, or change request<br />● logged to enhance the reporting of key metrics or thresholds, such as memory or interface buffer utilisation<br />
	<br />Dimension Data will monitor and manage the availability of configuration items (device) and the network, as well as capacity utilisation and technology service performance, by setting thresholds for configuration items and services as defined by the client.<br />Availability, capacity and performance-related events (whether informational or exceptions such as failures) are recorded and managed and, if required (in the case of exceptions), logged and addressed as an incident (see Incident Management).<br />It is critical however, for any event that affect networks, that the client be notified within 15 minutes of the actual detection of the ’failure‘ by our systems – referred as proactive notification. This notification can be via email or SMS.
	<br />Dimension Data will assist the client in determining the best threshold for each configuration item, instrumenting and monitoring services from network edge to network edge (Dimension Data’s scope of responsibility). Thresholds will only be set after a base-line period of three months, on agreement with the client.<br />
