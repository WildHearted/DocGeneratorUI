	<h1>Introduction to <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">Content Authoring</span></h1>
	<p>Most of the time, it seems straight forward to capture text, images and tables into documents like in MS Word, but with the Service Design and Development Portfolio (SDDP)System,&#160;things works a little different. The SDDP is an online system that is build/based/hosted as a SharePoint solution. Capturing content in an online system is a little different to writing/authoring MS Word documents, although the principles are the same.</p>
	<p>In the SDDP system, some content is captured as plain text fields (words without any formatting) and other content is captured as Enhanced Rich Text (ERT) content. Enhances Rich Text content are in essence words (text) but it includes formatting, tables and images/pictures and other forms of media as well. </p>
	<p>Depending on selections via the user interface (UI), the SharePoint content is processed by a server service application (the DocGenerator),&#160;and automatically author&#160;various MS Word and MS Excel documents.</p>
	<h2>Plain Text</h2>
	<p>SDDP store some&#160;content as Plain Text fields, which is&#160;pure text that doesn't contain any formatting or other types of artefacts. Therefore, there are very seldom any complications with Plain Text content.</p>
	<h2>Enhanced Rich Text</h2>
	<p>Enhanced Rich Text (ERT) fields are stored as HTML. As you may know, HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language) content can consist of text,&#160;formatting information and other artefacts like images, tables etc. The formatting&#160;indicates how the text and other artefacts are formatted and presented to the user. Most internet web sites are HTML which the browser you use, translates and displays as the web page you see on a monitor. The format “instructions” in HTML consist of a defined set of HTML tags. For example a &quot;p&quot; in sharp brackets (&lt;&gt; with a p between the brackets. We cannot put the p in the brackets because HTML will interpret it and insert a paragraph instead of displaying the example.)&#160;The tag&#160;H1 in sharp brackets&#160;means a&#160; separate Heading 1 paragraph.</p>
	<p>Each ERT field contains the text and the various HTML tags that indicate <strong>how</strong> the text is formatted.</p>
	<p>The DocGenerator&#160;reads, the HTML content, interpret it and then extrapolate it to construct the relevant documents and/or workbooks. The DocGenerator reads the HTML contained in an ERT field,&#160;then deciphers the HTML to determine the format of the text and each artefacts contained in the content. If the ERT content&#160;is <em>valid </em>and it contains sufficient format information for the DocGenerator to include it in the document, it translates the <strong>HTML </strong>into an <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">Open XML </span>format, which is the basis of all Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat documents.&#160;</p>
	<p>When the DocGenerator cannot determine how author intended the text and artefacts (tables or images) to be formatted, based on the HTML, it will indicate that the specific “generated” document contains content that it cannot interpret to produce a properly formatted document.</p>
	<p>Therefore, this purpose of this document is to provide you with a guideline, directions and tips on how to author valid and properly formatted content that the DocGenerator will be able to successfully read and translate,&#160;when it produce a document or workbook.</p>
