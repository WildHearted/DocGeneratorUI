	This is a div tag that contains text but no valid html tags. It is an exerpt from live data:  Events are diagnosed by validating them against predefined rules which are documented in the Monitoring Plan. This validation ensures that events that require action, trigger the relevant response.
	<br />Event handling is triggered from this automated validation response, when events are generated by Dimension Data’s monitoring systems.
	<br />Generally, event handling will be:<br />● automated or manual correlation to other events that generate an incident, request, problem, or change request<br />● logged to enhance the reporting of key metrics or thresholds, such as memory or interface buffer utilisation<br />
	<br />Dimension Data will monitor and manage the availability of configuration items (device) and the network, as well as capacity utilisation and technology service performance, by setting thresholds for configuration items and services as defined by the client.<br />Availability, capacity and performance-related events (whether informational or exceptions such as failures) are recorded and managed and, if required (in the case of exceptions), logged and addressed as an incident (see Incident Management).<br />It is critical however, for any event that affect networks, that the client be notified within 15 minutes of the actual detection of the ’failure‘ by our systems – referred as proactive notification. This notification can be via email or SMS.
	<br />Dimension Data will assist the client in determining the best threshold for each configuration item, instrumenting and monitoring services from network edge to network edge (Dimension Data’s scope of responsibility). Thresholds will only be set after a base-line period of three months, on agreement with the client.<br />
